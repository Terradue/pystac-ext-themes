# Contributing to the AERONET PySTAC extension

## Development setup

Install Python 3.10 or later, [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/), and [Task](https://taskfile.dev/). From a checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
task quality:pre-commit:install
```

## Quality gate

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
task
```

The default task runs the pre-commit hooks: strict mypy, Ruff formatting and lint checks, Bandit, and pytest across the configured Python 3.10–3.14 matrix. See `AGENTS.md` for the repository's code quality and schema-first rules.

The individual non-mutating checks are:

```bash
hatch run dev:format-check
hatch run dev:lint-check
hatch run dev:typecheck
hatch run dev:security
hatch run test:test
```

## Documentation

Documentation follows Diátaxis: tutorials teach a workflow, how-to guides solve tasks, reference pages describe the API, and explanation pages discuss design and scope.

Follow the [documentation build instructions](docs/how-to/install.md#preview-the-documentation) and run `mkdocs build --strict` before submitting documentation changes. Keep examples consistent with `src/pystac/extensions/themes.py` and the upstream [AERONET STAC specification](https://github.com/Terradue/themes-stac-extension).
